            Bee Movie
            By Jerry Seinfeld
            
            NARRATOR:
            (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
            According to all known laws
            of aviation,
             :
            there is no way a bee
            should be able to fly.
             :
            Its wings are too small to get
            its fat little body off the ground.
             :
            The bee, of course, flies anyway
             :
            because bees don't care
            what humans think is impossible.

            Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
            Yellow, black. Yellow, black.</p>
